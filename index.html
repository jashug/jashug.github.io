<h1>Jasper Hugunin</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am an undergraduate at the University of Washington studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
Working with Dr. Dan Grossman and Talia Ringer, I wrote a paper on <a href="https://github.com/jashug/ConstructingII">constructing inductive-inductive types in cubical type theory</a>.
I also contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq">Coq proof assistant</a>.
Currently I am applying to graduate school, working towards a PhD in type theory.
