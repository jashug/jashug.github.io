<h1>Times Table Tutor</h1>
<p>
A computer assistant to help me learn my times tables. Quick, what's 7 &times; 9?
</p>

<section>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
I worked on this project in 4th grade, when in school everyone had to learn
the times tables and pass a timed test.
The sort where everyone gets a worksheet with like 40 problems,
and you have a minute to fill it out,
and you need to get them all right to pass.
</p>
<p>
I was usually enjoying my math classes, but I wasn't very good at memorizing.
Making physical flash cards seemed boring,
and a lot of work to check the answers myself.
At the same time, I had just started learning Python,
so I decided to write a program to help me practice.

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
I ended up creating a program which randomly generated multiplication problems
like <samp>3 &times; 8 = ?</samp>,
waited for me to type in my answer <kbd>24</kbd>,
and then told me if I was correct or not before immediately moving on to the
next question.
This loop continued for as long as I wanted to keep practicing.
When I wanted to stop, I typed <kbd>q</kbd> instead of answering the question.
</p>
<p>
Once I was done, the program told me how many problems I had gotten correct
and how many I missed.
It also kept track of how much time I spent, and computed the average time
per problem.
These were important to me because
they were what I was being tested on in school.
It also made practicing feel more like a game,
with these statistics keeping score.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li>Memorized my times tables</li>
<li>Passed the test in school</li>
<li>Had fun using the program to practice</li>
<li>Practiced using Python</li>
<li>
  Developed a strategy for memorizing things (to have a program quiz you)
  that I would use again later on
  (see <a class="dead" href="japanese-tutor.html">Japanese Tutor</a>
   and <a class="dead" href="periodic-table-tutor.html">Periodic Table Tutor</a>).
<li>Gave my dad a good story to brag about at Python conferences</li>
</ul>
