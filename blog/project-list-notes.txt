Dates and details are vague and from memory; should be more records on harddrive
in Seattle.

* Open up python, raw_input("Hello, world! (Press enter to exit): "),
  trying to make it wait for a different key.

+ Multiplication tables practice <times-table-tutor.html>

+ Gemcraft clone <match-three.html>

* Turing complete systems (from mechanical computers to lambda calculus)
  (Maybe broken up? But I didn't actually do too much with each of these
   that I remember)
  - Lambda calculus evaluator (early Python)
  - Lambda calculus on a Turing machine (UW with Adam)
  - Fractrain
  - Mechanical computer (high school CAD)
