<h1>Match-3 Game</h1>
<p>
A match 3 game, like Candy Crush&trade; or Bejewled&trade;.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
When I was much younger, my family had a rule that I could only play video games
for half an hour per day, <em>except</em> for games I built myself.
This rule was a big motivating factor as I was learning Python.
</p>
<p>
At the time, my mother was occationally playing Bejewled&trade;, and I wanted to
play too. To get around my half-hour limit, I tried to build a match three game
myself.

<section>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
Using Pygame, a game-making library for Python,
I did make a game that shows a grid of colored dots, and where
you can swap neighboring dots with the mouse to match three.
However, the controls were clunky and I didn't know how many colors to use or
how to keep score. I ended up making it get progressively harder, adding one
new color after each level.
</p>
<p>
Actually playing the game was fun for a little bit,
but became boring pretty quickly.
