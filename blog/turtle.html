<h1>Turtle Language</h1>
<p>
An interpreter for a programming language combining turtle graphics and BASIC.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
In elementary school, every week or so we went to the computer lab.
Sometimes we practiced typing or other things, but sometimes we got to play
a certain game. The game had a turtle on the screen that moved in response
to typed commands, and you had to move around the screen to win.
</p>
<p>
Upon learning that Python has a <code>turtle</code> module to do the same sort
of thing, I started playing around with it at home. I could have been content
to work from within Python, but I had also been thinking about programming
languages more generally, including compilers and interpreters like I knew my
dad worked on.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I worked on writing an interpreter in Python that would read
and execute commands from a text file written in my own made-up language.
</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
In the end, I created a pretty complex language,
and drew lots of pretty pictures.
When I'm next in Seattle I ought to dig the source out of my backups.
</p>
<p>
My language started with simple commands to move the turtle around the screen:
go forward, turn left, and so on.
But without the ability to loop, drawing pictures gets boring pretty fast.
I then added control constructs like loops, if-else statements, and variables,
again with an arbitrary syntax inspired by BASIC
(why BASIC and not Python I do not remember).
</p>
<p>
In any case, the control constructs looked nothing like the drawing constructs.
The language grew organically, with me adding new ideas as I came up with them
and not worrying too much about if they made sense together.
Looking back, the language was a bit of a mess, but it was good enough to
draw fun pictures and let me think about interesting choices programming
languages make and gave me a better
understanding of the difference between a compiler and an interpreter.

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
If you want to try this project yourself, maybe start with a
program that asks the user for commands like <kbd>forward 100</kbd>, then
runs that command using the <code>turtle</code> module.
Once you've got that working for simple commands, have it read the commands
from a file instead.
</p>
<p>
If that works, you've successfully written an interpreter.
Now you can start adding features to your language to do whatever you want.
