<h1>Fun Wheels to Reinvent &mdash; a Blog-like-thing by Jasper Hugunin</h1>
<p>
Over the past 10 or so years, from elementary school through graduating college
with bachelor's degrees in Math and Computer Science, I've worked on a lot of
projects in my free time. Many of these projects have been doing what other
people have done before, and doing it worse&mdash;reinventing the wheel.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, these projects were both fun and educational.
I feel that they gave me a better understanding of both how things work and
why they work that way. They gave me a chance to both practice making things
and to explore what would happen if things were different.
</p>
<p>
Here, I'll try to collect a record of what I've done and why I
enjoyed it.
If you have some free time and are looking for a fun project,
you might find something here that inspires you.

<h2>(Planned) Structure of a Post</h2>
<p>
In each post, I'll look at one of the projects I've done,
focusing on four things:
</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Context</em>: Why did I want to do this project?</li>
<li><em>Result</em>: What did I end up creating?</li>
<li><em>Skills</em>: What skills did I practice in this project?</li>
<li>
  <em>Resources</em>:
  What would someone else need to get started on the same project?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I plan to add content out of order, so if you want to know what I've recently
written, your best bet might be the
<a href="https://github.com/jashug/jashug.github.io/tree/master/blog">
version history
</a>
of this site.
