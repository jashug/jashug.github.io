<h1>Virtual Construction Set</h1>
<p>
Build with virtual Zome&trade; pieces.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
There are lots of toys aimed at kids where you have a bunch of plastic pieces
that you snap together to make things. Best known is probably LEGO,
but there are also K'Nex, ZOOB, Lincoln Logs, Zome, and more.
</p>
<p>
I played with many of these as a kid, but in middle school I was currently
interested in Zome in particular. A family friend got me a starter kit that
came with a book about using Zome to explore mathematics,
which I found interesting.
</p>
<p>
I had also been making several HTML games using the canvas element, and trying
to make something 3D sounded interesting.
</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
I created a system which lets you create and view Zome models in 3D.
Using the system, I created several models including the shadow of a
hyperdodecahedron, which I now use as the favicon for this website and
a profile picture online.

<p>
The controls for looking around and building were a pretty confusing mix of
keyboard shortcuts and mouse movement, at least according to my dad when he
tried to use it. They made perfect sense to me! But coming up with a better
control scheme would have been a good next step.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I wanted to do was to add a tool to do symmetry automatically.
Lots of Zome models have lots of symmetry (both reflective and rotational),
and working virtually is a great opportunity
to let the computer do the repetitive work for you.
</p>
<p>
You could also save and load models, which were stored on the server.
However, this system was terrible from a security perspective because it
was implemented using eval, making it trivial to inject arbitrary code,
which I realized later after learning more about web security.
</p>
<p>
One fun thing was the math behind how to specify the positions of the balls.
In Zome, the lengths of the struts get bigger by factors of the golden ratio
&phi;, so coordinates are irrational.
It was important to me to be able to reliably
compare whether two balls were at the same position or not, so I didn't want
to rely on floating point numbers. What I ended up doing was representing
positions in what I called at the time &ldquo;base phi&rdquo;, but I would now
call the algebraic extension of the integers by the golden ratio.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, the trick was to represent positions with two integers
<var>a</var> and <var>b</var> representing <var>a</var> + <var>b</var>&#8729;&phi;.
Since &phi;<sup>2</sup> = &phi; + 1, you can multiply these positions by &phi;,
and since they are just two integers underneeth, they are easy to compare exactly.

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
If you want to try this project yourself, choose a construction kit you want
to simulate. Then learn how to draw the pieces using WebGL. Then decide how
you want to represent models (connected groups of pieces), and what control
scheme you want to use for building.
